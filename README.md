# Deprecated

This was a Gnome extension to enable tray icons.

When Gnome 45 was released, [a major rewrite](https://gjs.guide/extensions/upgrading/gnome-shell-45.html#esm) was needed to keep this extension working.

The suggestion is to migrate to a better maintained project, such as [gnome-shell-extension-appindicator](https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator).

## Tray Icons

Simple version of [TopIcons Plus](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1031/topicons/).

Base on TopIcons Plus v22 from [GNOME Shell Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/).

Keep it as simple as possible.
